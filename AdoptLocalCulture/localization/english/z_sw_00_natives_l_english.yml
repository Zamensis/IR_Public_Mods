 # EMBRACE LOCAL CULTURE EVENTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 z_sw_natives.100.t:0 "Cultural Shift"
 z_sw_natives.100.desc:0 "We came from afar to conquer this country, and so it is only natural that the local population considers us foreign usurpators. Today we embrace the language and customs of these lands in the hopes of cementing our legitimacy for the centuries to come."
 z_sw_natives.100.a:0 "We are now [z_sw_embraced_majority.GetName]."
 z_sw_natives.100.at:0 "#Y [z_sw_ruling_minority.GetName]#! culture is demoted to @citizens! #Y Citizen#! rights"
 z_sw_natives.201.t:0 "Cultural Opposition"
 z_sw_natives.201.desc:0 "We knew that our cultural reforms would be met with strong resistance from the most conservative members of the former [z_sw_deposed_minority.GetName] elite. It is no secret either that they are enjoying strong support from the local population in [z_sw_deposed_minority_capital.GetName], our biggest [z_sw_deposed_minority.GetName] center besides the capital.\n\nOur agents report that [z_sw_deposed_minority_leader.GetName] has secretly pledged his support to the opposition. That makes him the highest ranking official to do so, their the facto leader, presumably a pretender to the throne.\n\nAs our country faces difficult times, we should deal with this situation before the opposition takes the initiative."
 z_sw_natives.201.a:0 "Disperse the opposition."
 z_sw_natives.201.at1:0 "The opposition is effectively dispersed."
 z_sw_natives.201.at2:0 "@war_icon! A civil war erupts."

 z_sw_natives.301.t:0 "Cultural Opposition"
 z_sw_natives.301.desc:0 "We could predict that our cultural conversion would not be easily accepted by the most conservative elements of the [z_sw_embraced_majority.GetName] population.\n\nAs our agents report, [z_sw_embraced_majority_leader.GetName] has started to portray himself as the only true legitimate [z_sw_embraced_majority.GetName] ruler. He is the highest ranking official to join this opposition, so that makes him their de facto leader, a true pretender to the throne.\n\nAs our country faces difficult times, we should deal with this situation before he takes the initiative."
 z_sw_natives.301.a:0 "Disperse the opposition."
 z_sw_natives.301.at1:0 "The opposition is effectively dispersed."

 # EMBRACE LOCAL CULTURE MODIFIERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 z_sw_native_majority:0 "Native Majority"
 desc_z_sw_native_majority:0 "Because this culture represents at least 50% of the population in our capital province, capital region or whole country, it considers itself denied of its rightful political representation, and oppressed by an illegitimate, foreign minority."
 z_sw_local_culture_embraced_country:0 "Local Culture Adopted"
 desc_z_sw_local_culture_embraced_country:0 "Our nation is undergoing a radical cultural shift. The ruling minority has been replaced by the majority it thought it had conquered."
 z_sw_deposed_culture:0 "Deposed Elite"
 desc_z_sw_deposed_culture:0 "Not so long ago, this minority ruled undisputed over our country. The loss of this position of privilege naturally causes this people a lot of anxiety and anger."
 z_sw_embraced_culture:0 "Culture Recognized"
 desc_z_sw_embraced_culture:0 "For too long, this majority had been denied its rightful place in our society. Having been recognized at last, these people are more optimistic about their future."
 # EMBRACE LOCAL CULTURE DECISION --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 z_sw_embrace_local_culture_decision:0 "Adopt Local Culture"
 z_sw_embrace_local_culture_decision_desc:0 "We came from afar to conquer this country, and so it is only natural that the local population considers us foreign usurpators. We must embrace the language and customs of these lands to cement our legitimacy."
