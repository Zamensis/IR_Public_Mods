 z_vanilla.1.desc:0 "Traders arrive with a new and exotic treasure, #E Vanilla#!, claiming it will turn our provinces into a wonderland of unimaginable wealth. They say it will change everything: a new era of strategy, smarter armies, grand battles, completely rebalanced world economy, ... A #E total conversion#! of everything we know of. A real #E game-changer#!. We were pleasantly surprised when it didn't explode in our faces.\n\nAs it turns out, it's just a little bean that smells nice, quietly sitting in our warehouses and doing nothing dramatic at all.\n\nShould we keep it?"
 z_vanilla.1.a:0 "Begin production in [z_vanilla_province_1.GetName]"

 z_vanilla.2.desc:0 "A few years have passed since #E Vanilla#! first appeared in our lands. Against all odds, it did not crash the market. In fact, it's become oddly popular. Not because it grants power, wealth, or divine wisdom, but simply because it didn't shatter any hypotetically crazy expectation.\n\nNeighboring peoples, hearing the extravagant tales, are now eager to partake. They expect a treasure beyond imagination, a revolution that will alter the very fabric of their exitence. Of course, we know the truth: it's just a bean. Aromatic, pleasant, and incapable of saving anyone's collapsing empire.\n\nNow the question falls to us: do we generously share this #E game-changing#! marvel, watching our neighbors swoon over nothing more than a sweet pod... or do we keep it close, enjoying the smug satisfaction of being the only ones not duped by overblown promises?"
 z_vanilla.2.a:0 "Sure. Give them some."
 z_vanilla.2.at1:0 "Whoa!"
 z_vanilla.2.at2:0 "This is so #G cool#!."

 z_vanilla.3.t:0 "$z_vanilla.1.t$"
 z_vanilla.3.desc:0 "Messengers from [z_vanilla_country_source.GetName] have arrived bearing a curious gift: #E Vanilla#!. They swear it is no grand miracle, no world-breaking force of destiny, no 'era-defining wonder' that will collapse under its own weight the moment we look at it too closely. Instead, it is exactly what it claims to be, a bean that smells nice.\n\nFrankly, we are stunned. We had grown so accustomed to lofty promises of greatness delivered in a fortnight, only to be rewarded with disappointment and despair, that something so bland actually feels revolutionary. Could it be that the greatest treasure of all is not boundless power, but the sheer relief of something that simply tastes as promised? What a #E game-changing#! experience, indeed."
 z_vanilla.3.a:0 "Huh... Okay?"
 z_vanilla.3.b:0 "Whatever you're smoking, I want some."

 z_vanilla.4.t:0 "$z_vanilla.1.t$"
 z_vanilla.4.desc:0 "For a fleeting instant, the thought seemed brilliant: simply add #E Vanilla#! to everything, and the world would revert to its plain, uninspired form. The idea sparkled with dangerous allure, promising relief from complexity... and perhaps a hint of madness.\n\nYet clarity struck soon after. To embrace such a path would be folly beyond measure, a plunge into absurdity from which no pride could return. The temptation fades, leaving only the faint laughter of one who nearly believed their own nonsense."
 z_vanilla.4.a:0 "This is all Greek to me."
 z_vanilla.4.at1:0 "Nothing happens."

 z_vanilla.5.desc:0 "Years have passed, and still #E Vanilla#! lingers. At first, it was a curiosity, then a joke, then a temptation. Now it simply is. Permanent, unavoidable, like the background hum of existence. We have no decision to make, no path to choose. #E Vanilla#! endures, indifferent to our agency."
 z_vanilla.5.a:0 "Okay, what the hell is this?"
 z_vanilla.5.at1:0 "Nothing happens."
 z_vanilla.5.b:0 "Tell me more..."
 z_vanilla.5.bt1:0 "Nothing happens."

 z_vanilla.6.desc:0 "You thought this was about trade, or balance, or strategy. But no. It was always about me, pouring thoughts into your screen like a deranged oracle muttering over a bean. #E Vanilla#! is not a flavor, nor a good, nor even a concept. #E Vanilla#! is a state of mind. Your state of mind."
