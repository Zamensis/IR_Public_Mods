 roman_1_italia_DESCRIPTION:0 "Since the founding of Roma by Romulus hundreds of years ago, our proud city has skirmished with our Italic neighbors, vying for control of the coasts and cities of Latium and Campania. Our recent victories over the Etruscans and Samnites have proved our superiority, and it is clear that it is Rome who is destined to unite the Italic peoples and lead them to glory. When this is done, the islands that lay off the Italian peninsula are natural targets for expanding Rome's influence and depriving Punic and Greek colonists of the rich spoils these rugged lands hold. The Italic and Gallic tribes to the north hold sway over the fertile Padus valley and block our land access to the north. We will have to sweep aside these pitiful tribes and secure the rich lands of Cisalpine Gaul for Rome."
