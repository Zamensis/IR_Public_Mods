 # EVENTS -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 z_dfo_common.1.t:0 "The Silenced Majority"
 z_dfo_common.1.desc:0 "The balance of cultures in our lands has changed. In the past, the [z_dfo_old_cultural_majority.GetName] culture had represented the majority of our core population, but it is now just one among many more. With no culture able to claim clear predominance, the old tensions lose their focus and the [z_dfo_old_ruling_minority.GetName] rule is no longer contested."
 z_dfo_common.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 # -----------
 z_dfo_common.2.t:0 "The Unsilent Majority"
 z_dfo_common.2.desc.diadochi:0 "The empire we rule was forged by conquest, not consensus. Though our dynasty claims the legacy of a great conqueror, the lands in our control are filled with peoples whose customs, tongues, and traditions differ from ours. They are many, and we are few: our [z_dfo_ruling_minority.GetName] minority presides over the [z_dfo_found_cultural_majority.GetName] majority, that does not yet see itself reflected in the throne.\n\nFor now, this imbalance holds, sustained by prestige, arms, and habit. Yet beneath the surface, discontent stirs. Should we seek to bend these peoples to our will and reshape them in our image, or must we one day accept that our empire has changed us as much as we have changed it?\n\n$z_dfo_cm_definition$"
 z_dfo_common.2.desc.monarchy:0 "Our crown rests upon ancient rights and established custom, yet the realm it governs is not as uniform as tradition would suggest. The culture of the court does not wholly match that of the people, and while the ruling [z_dfo_ruling_minority.GetName] elite prospers, the [z_dfo_found_cultural_majority.GetName] majority watches from a distance, tolerated but not embraced.\n\nSuch arrangements can endure for a time. But history teaches that harmony imposed from above is fragile. We must decide whether to strengthen our authority over the many, or reconsider upon whom the kingdom truly stands.\n\n$z_dfo_cm_definition$"
 z_dfo_common.2.desc.republic:0 "Though our republic proclaims the rule of law and citizen virtue, its foundations are more complex than its ideals suggest. Political power is held by our [z_dfo_ruling_minority.GetName] minority, while the [z_dfo_found_cultural_majority.GetName] part of the population remains outside the circle of full belonging, governed rather than represented.\n\nThis quiet contradiction strains the fabric of civic life. As voices grow louder and loyalties waver, the republic must confront an uncomfortable question: can a state built on shared governance endure without a shared identity?\n\n$z_dfo_cm_definition$"
 z_dfo_common.2.desc.tribal:0 "Our people are bound together by tradition and kinship, yet even among our tribes, change has taken root. One culture leads, but many more follow, and the balance between them is uneasy. The [z_dfo_ruling_minority.GetName] people who rules does so by custom, while greater [z_dfo_found_cultural_majority.GetName] numbers live by ways not fully their own.\n\nFor now, the tribe endures as it always has. But as pressures mount and paths diverge, we must choose whether to impose unity by force of will... or allow the tribe itself to become something new.\n\n$z_dfo_cm_definition$"
 z_dfo_common.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 z_dfo_common.2.b:0 "This situation is hardly exceptional."

 # -----------
 z_dfo_cm_definition:0 "----------\nThe [z_dfo_found_cultural_majority.GetName] culture represents the majority of the population in our country, capital region, capital province or capital territory. Until this situation changes, tensions may arise periodically between the [z_dfo_found_cultural_majority.GetName] majority and the [z_dfo_ruling_minority.GetName] ruling minority. After at least 20 years have passed, two #E Mission Trees#! will become available and allow us to resolve this issue permanently."

 z_dfo_common.4.t:0 "The Silent Majority"
 z_dfo_common.4.desc:0 "The balance of cultures in our lands has changed. Through conquest, settlement, or the slow march of generations, the [z_dfo_found_cultural_majority.GetName] people has grown to outnumber the [z_dfo_old_cultural_majority.GetName], , becoming the foremost culture among the governed.\n\nYet power remains where it has always been. The ruling [z_dfo_ruling_minority.GetName] elite still stands apart, unchanged by this transformation below. Whether this new balance will remain a mere statistic, or grow into a force demanding recognition, is a question the future alone will answer.\n\n$z_dfo_cm_definition$"
 z_dfo_common.4.a:0 "Interesting."

 z_dfo_common.5.desc:0 "When a country like our own has a #E cultural majority#!, the primary culture is considered a #E ruling minority#!. A #E cultural majority#! is a non-primary culture which represents the majority of the population in a country, capital region, capital province or capital territory.\n\nBelow are the lists of all countries with a #E ruling minority#!
