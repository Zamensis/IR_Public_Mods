# Zamensis' Imperator Rome mods repository

I make mods for my own use and if I think they're cool I share them.

## Descriptions

You can find detailed descriptions of each mod on their respective Steam [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029731898/myworkshopfiles/?appid=859580) pages.
This repo is just an alternative way to access them for those who can't (or don't want to) use the Workshop.

## How-to

If you're using Steam, the easiest way is still to subscribe to my mods on the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029731898/myworkshopfiles/?appid=859580).\
Otherwise, follow these steps to install a mod from this repository manually:

### 1. Download the mod

* Navigate to the folder of the mod you want to install.
* Copy the URL of that folder.
* Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/) to download it as a ZIP.

### 2. Set up the mod folder

* Unzip the file you've just downloaded.
* Move the mod folder into into:\
`"~Documents\Paradox Interactive\Imperator\mod\"`
* Make a copy of the file `descriptor.mod` you'll find inside the downloaded folder, and put it into:\
`"~Documents\Paradox Interactive\Imperator\mod\"`
* Open that copy of `descriptor.mod` using any text editor (e.g. Notepad).
* Add this line at the end:\
`path="C:/Users/<username>/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Imperator/mod/<exact downloaded folder name>"`
* Save, close, crack yourself a beer.

### 3. Add the mod to a playset

* In the Paradox Launcher, click on `Playsets` on the left.
* Select the playset you want to add the mod, or create a new one.
* Click on `Add more mods`.
* Find the mod in the list, and tick the checkbox next to it.
* Click on `Add 1 to playset`.
* Done.

### Troubleshooting

* See [this page](https://imperator.paradoxwikis.com/Mods) on the [Imperator Rome Wiki](https://imperator.paradoxwikis.com).
* If you're still having problems, feel free to ask for help on the [Invictus discord server](https://discord.gg/YM82a5Ak).\
